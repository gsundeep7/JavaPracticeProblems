# JavaPracticeProblems
This repo contains the Java Practice Problems 

------------------Practice questions of Datatypes & Variables-----------------------
üî∏ Basic Level:
1. Write a program to declare all primitive data types and print their values.
2. Write a program to add two integer numbers and display the result.
3. Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle.
   ‚ûù Formula: area = length * width
4. Write a program to swap two numbers using a temporary variable.
5. Write a program to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.
6. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle.
‚ûù Formula: area = œÄ * r * r
7. Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
8. Write a program to convert distance from kilometers to miles.
9. Write a program to calculate Simple Interest.
‚ûù Formula: SI = (P * T * R) / 100
10. Write a program to calculate the perimeter of a square.
‚ûù Formula: Perimeter = 4 * side

üî∏ Intermediate Level:

11. Write a program to calculate the average of three numbers.
12. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle using instance variables.
13. Write a program to demonstrate local, instance, and static variables.
14. Write a program to demonstrate the difference between float and double with precision.
15. Write a program to convert minutes into hours and minutes.
‚ûù Example: 150 minutes = 2 hours and 30 minutes
16. Write a program to calculate the total and average marks of 5 subjects.
17. Write a program to find the ASCII value of a character.
18. Write a program to calculate compound interest.
‚ûù Formula: CI = P*(1 + R/100)^T - P
19. Write a program to compute the area of different shapes like circle, rectangle, and triangle by using different variables.
20. Write a program to show how boolean variables work with logical operations.

üî∏ Challenge Level:
21. Write a program to accept two numbers and display the maximum and minimum number.
22. Write a program to convert seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds.
23. Write a program to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index).
‚ûù Formula: BMI = weight / (height * height)
24. Write a program to convert inches to meters.
25. Write a program to demonstrate type casting (implicit and explicit) between different data types.

‚≠ê Bonus Idea:
Combine multiple data types (int, float, String, char, boolean) in one program that outputs your profile details, such as name, age, grade, height, and pass/fail status.
